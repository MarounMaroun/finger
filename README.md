# finger

When you feel you want to finger someone (including yourself), simply run finger!


### Installing

Download the files and run

### Running

`finger` selects a random finger and raises it for you.

It will slowly raise it so you can enjoy every moment of it.


```bash
:$ finger
    |_|                       |_|
    | |         /^^^\         | |
   _| |_      (| "o" |)      _| |_
 _| | | | _    (_---_)    _ | | | |_
| | | | |' |    _| |_    | `| | | | |
|          |   /     \   |          |
 \        /  / /(. .)\ \  \        /
   \    /  / /  | . |  \ \  \    /
     \  \/ /    ||Y||    \ \/  /
      \__/      || ||      \__/
                () ()
                || ||
               ooO Ooo
```

You can specify the speed of the loading, when 0 it'll load the finger immediately:

```bash
:$ finger 0
         /"\
        |\./|
        |   |
        |   |
        |>~<|
        |   |
     /'\|   |/'\..
 /~\|   |   |   | \
|   =[@]=   |   |  \
|   |   |   |   |   \
| ~   ~   ~   ~ |`   )
|                   /
 \                 /
  \               /
   \    _____    /
    |--//''`\--|
    | (( +==)) |
    |--\_|_//--|

```
