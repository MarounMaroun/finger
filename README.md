You can specify the speed of the loading, when 0 it'll load the finger immediately:

```bash
:$ finger 0
         /"\
        |\./|
        |   |
        |   |
        |>~<|
        |   |
     /'\|   |/'\..
 /~\|   |   |   | \
|   =[@]=   |   |  \
|   |   |   |   |   \
| ~   ~   ~   ~ |`   )
|                   /
 \                 /
  \               /
   \    _____    /
    |--//''`\--|
    | (( +==)) |
    |--\_|_//--|

```

<sup>If you're using the major UNIX command `finger`, you can change the file name and edit `install.sh` accordingly</sup>
